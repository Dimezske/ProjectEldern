Notes:

If you look at the sprite atlas, the gear is sorted the same way as the human sprite.

THe human Sprite and sword are included in the baseset:

The sorting looks approximately like this:
idle normal loop 1, 				idle aggro loop 1
idle normal loop 2, 				idle aggro loop 2
walk normal, 					walk aggro
run normal,					run aggro
							Fist Attack
Light Attack			gettinghit N,	sitting N
				gettinghit E,	sitting E	Dead 
				gettinghit S,	sitting S
Heavy Attack


Most of the animations are created with having a basic framerate of 10 - 12 fps in mind (that's 80ms - 100ms per frame)
You should set the geear speed to the same speeds you set for the human character.

Armor Gear specifics:
-the idle gear animation can be applied to both loops of the human idlestrips (blinking doesn't alter the gear)
-the walk and run animations can be applied to both loops of the human idlestrips (mnormal and aggro)

Weapon Gear Specifics:
Weapon Animation does not Exist for the normal idle (weapon is put away)
The weapon always should be applied to the aggro human basesprites
